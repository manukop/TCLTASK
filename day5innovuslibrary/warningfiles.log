**WARN: (IMPDB-2078):	Output pin wb_inta_o of instance i2c_master_top_inst1 is connected to ground net vss.  Usually it is not right to connect an output signal pin to a P/G net, unless the pin is meant to be the driver of the net. This can create a short circuit if the output is power.  Check the connectivity in the netlist.
